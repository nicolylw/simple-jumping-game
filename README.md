# simple-jumping-game
Based on Chrome's dinosaur running game. My basic JS version consisting of the game's foundations built using &lt;canvas>.

[Demo here](https://nicolylw.github.io/simple-jumping-game)

## Features
- Spacebar and mouse click interaction.
- High score local storage.
- Pipe speed (levels) increased at every 100 score intervals.
- Single jump only.
- Random pipe height and width at each run.

## Still working on
- Circle and rectangle collision.
